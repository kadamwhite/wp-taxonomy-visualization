# WordPress Tag Visualization

This application spiders the tags & categories in use on a REST API-enabled WordPress website (4.7 or later), expecting the website to exist at `website.loc`. Tag co-incidence is visualized through a force-directed graph using D3.js.

Run `npm install` to install dependencies. Once installed, use the command `npm start` to spin up the development server, which will be accessible at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
